# Iainbot - A discord bot inspired by one of my lecturers.

# Getting started
1. Make sure you've downloaded Python 3.9
2. Create a virtual environment on this folder with `venv`
3. Enter the virtual environment using the `activate` script in \Scripts
4. Use `pip` to download discord.py: `pip install discord.py`
5. Create a file called `iain.cfg` and structure it like so:

        [INFO]
        token = your-bot-token
        
6. Run the bot!
